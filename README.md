Use JavaScript to build a nav bar dynamically, not coded in the HTML file.
​
### Add functionality to show the section in viewport
​
The section that is active in the viewport should be easily recognised from the other ones.
​
### Add the functionality to scroll to sections
​
Smooth scroll effect is expected when moving to the selected section of the page.
​
### Create a subscription form

The form should collect the name and e-mail of the user.
